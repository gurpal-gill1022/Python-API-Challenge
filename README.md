# Python-API-Challenge: WeatherPy & VacationPy

## Project Description

This project consists of using python, APIs, and JSON traversals to solve two problems:
- What is the weather like as we approach the equator?
- Listening hotels in each city based on the ideal weather.

The tasks for this project included:
- creating a URL and looping all of the websites to retrieve the required weather data
- convert the data into DataFrame
- creating scatterplots to determine relationship between two variables
- creating regression plots to determine relationship between two variables
- creating map plots
- written analysis to communicate findings
